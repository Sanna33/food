    <p1><b><li>Ingredients</b></p1></li>
       <li> 1 small onion, diced </li>
        <li>500g good-quality beef mince</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 burger buns</li>
         <li>Any condiments of your choice</li>
    </p1>
    <p2>
       <b><li>Method</li></b>
        <li>STEP 1
        Tip 500g beef mince into a bowl with 1 small diced onion and 1 egg, then mix.</li>

       <li>STEP 2
        Divide the mixture into four. Lightly wet your hands. Carefully roll the mixture into balls, each about the size of a tennis ball. </li>

        <li>STEP 3
        Set in the palm of your hand and gently squeeze down to flatten into patties about 3cm thick. Make sure all the burgers are the same thickness so that they will cook evenly.

        <li>STEP 4
        Put on a plate, cover with cling film and leave in the fridge to firm up for at least 30 mins.</li>

        <li>STEP 5
        Heat the barbecue to medium hot (there will be white ash over the red hot coals – about 40 mins after lighting). Lightly brush one side of each burger with vegetable oil. </li>

        <li>STEP 6
        Place the burgers, oil-side down, on the barbecue. Cook for 5 mins until the meat is lightly charred. Don’t move them around or they may stick.</li>

        <li>STEP 7
        Oil the other side, then turn over using tongs. Don’t press down on the meat, as that will squeeze out the juices.</li>

        <li> STEP 8
        Cook for 5 mins more for medium. If you like your burgers pink in the middle, cook 1 min less each side. For well done, cook 1 min more.</li>

        <li> STEP 9
        Take the burgers off the barbecue. Leave to rest on a plate so that all the juices can settle inside.</li>

        <li>STEP 10
        Slice four burger buns in half. Place, cut-side down, on the barbecue rack and toast for 1 min until they are lightly charred. Place a burger inside each bun, then top with your choice of accompaniment.</li>

    <h3 class="display-1">&hearts;Pizzas&hearts;</h3>
    <p3><li><b>Ingredients</b></li>
        <li>300g strong bread flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp instant yeast (from a sachet or a tub)</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling</li>
        <li>100ml passata</li>
        <li>handful fresh basil or 1 tsp dried</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li>
        <li>125g ball mozzarella, sliced</li>
        <li>handful grated or shaved parmesan (or vegetarian alternative)</li>
        <li> handful of cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>handful of basil leaves (optional)</p3></li>
    <p4> 
        <li><b>Method</li></b>
            <li>STEP 1
        Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust. </li>

        <li>STEP 2
        Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</li>

        <li>STEP 3
        Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets. </li>

        <li>STEP 4
        Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.</li>
